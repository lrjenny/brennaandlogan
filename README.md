This project was a gift for my girlfriend.

It houses several projects that I've built with and for her.

Machine Learning:
I trained a TensorFlow char-gen with her favorite media (movie scripts, song lyrics, etc) and pasted a snippet of the resutls into the site as a gift.

The Shelf:
A virtual shelf that holds some house plant pixel art we drew.
